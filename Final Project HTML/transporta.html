            <p> Pravitha, a customer relations officer with SMRT, recalls the circuit breaker period last year, as among the most challenging phases of her career. "One one hand, I was worried for myself and my family, as there was great uncertainty regarding the spread of the virus. One the other hand, I had to deal with the concerns of fellow staff as a Youth Wing Leader of the SMRT Union," she said </p> 

            <p> While she counts herself as lucky due to having the unwavering support of her husband Subin,37, a counsellor at Changi Prison, she says that she is well aware that many of her colleagues do not have it easy. "We had put in place huddle sessions, buddy systems as well as flexible work arrangments, all as means of pyschological support for staff at work" </p>

            <p>Having admitted to 'binge shopping' at the start of the pandemic, she says that she has taken to more healthy habits such as hiking and cycling. Healthy ways to cope with pandemic related anxieties, she says, are more sustainable.</p>
